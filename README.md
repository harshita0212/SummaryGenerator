# SummaryGenerator
This project involves a web application that summarizes any text or articles using Flask, an easy-to-use Python web framework. The NLP model, which powers the text summarization in the backend, is built using the Spacy library, a robust toolkit for Natural Language Processing.
# Key Components:
Backend with Flask: Flask is used as the backend framework to handle the web app's routing and requests. It serves as the central point for receiving text input from the user, processing it with the Spacy-based NLP model, and returning the summary.

# Text Summarization using Spacy: 
Spacy is known for its efficient text processing pipelines. It handles tokenization, named entity recognition, and sentence boundary detection, making it ideal for summarizing long texts. The Spacy model helps in:

# Parsing the input text.
Identifying key sentences based on sentence structure and significance.
Creating a concise summary by selecting important sentences while discarding redundant or irrelevant information.
Frontend with Bootstrap: For styling and making the interface responsive, Bootstrap is used on the frontend. It provides a clean and professional look, with features such as:

# A user-friendly form where users can paste text or upload files.
Well-structured layout for displaying the original text and its summary.
Custom styling for buttons, input fields, and summary sections, ensuring the app is mobile-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.

# Project Workflow:
User Input: The web app has a text box where users can input their article or text for summarization.

Processing via Flask: Once the input is submitted, Flask sends the text to the backend, where the NLP model built with Spacy processes it.

Summarization: The Spacy model analyzes the text, identifies important sentences, and creates a summary.

Output Display: The summarized text is returned and displayed on the webpage, with Bootstrap ensuring the interface is clear and readable.
This web app is highly functional for students, researchers, or anyone looking for a quick summary of lengthy texts, thanks to the powerful combination of Flask for backend logic and Spacy for natural language processing.
